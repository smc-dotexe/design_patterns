Gamma Categorization
- design patterns typically split into three categories
	- Creational Patterns: 
		- Deal with the creation (construction) of objects
		- Explicit (constructor) vs implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
		- Wholesale (single statement) vs piecewise (step-by-step)
	- Structural Patterns:
		- Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members)
		- Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class' interface
		- Stress the importance of good API design
	- Behavioral Patterns:
		- They are all different; no central theme
