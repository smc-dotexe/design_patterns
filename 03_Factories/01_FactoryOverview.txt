Factory Pattern Overview:

Motivation:
- Object creation logic becomes too convoluted
- Constructor is not descriptive
	- Name mandated by name of containing type
	- Cannot overload with same sets of arguments with different names	
	- Can turn into 'optional parameter hell'
- Object creation (non-piecewise, unlike Builder) can be outsourced to
	- A separate function (Factory Method)
	- That may exist in a separate class (Factory)
	- Can create hierarchy of factories with Abstract Factory

Summary:
A component responsible solely for the wholesale (not piecewise) 
creation of objects
